# Cold Email Outreach Guide

## 🎯 Why Cold Emails Work

**Stats:**
- 50% of jobs are filled before posting
- Cold emails have 5-15% response rate

**When to use:**
- Dream companies not hiring publicly
- Startups in your tech stack
- After seeing their GitHub/tech blog
- Companies you genuinely admire

## 🔍 Finding Companies to Email

### **Method 1: Tech Stack Match**

**Find companies using your tech:**

1. **Search GitHub:**
   ```
   "Next.js" "tRPC" "careers"
   "built with Next.js" "we're hiring"
   ```

2. **Check Vercel Showcase:**
   - https://vercel.com/customers
   - Filter for companies using Next.js
   - Check if they're hiring

3. **Search Twitter/X:**
   ```
   "Next.js" "React" "hiring"
   "tRPC" "looking for"
   "TypeScript engineer" "remote"
   ```

4. **Check Tech Blogs:**
   - Read engineering blogs
   - If they write about your stack → reach out

---

### **Method 2: Y Combinator Companies**

**YC companies = well-funded, fast-growing:**

1. Go to: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies
2. Filter:
   - Batch: Recent (W24, S24, W25)
   - Industry: B2B, SaaS, Developer Tools, Fintech
   - Team Size: 2-50
   - Status: Active
3. Check their tech stack (job posts, GitHub, product)
4. Reach out if using Next.js/TypeScript/Python

**Why YC companies:**
- Have funding (can pay well)
- Growing fast (always hiring)
- Want talent quickly
- Open to cold outreach

---

### **Method 3: Product Hunt Launches**

**New products = hiring soon:**

1. Browse: https://www.producthunt.com/
2. Filter: Developer Tools, SaaS, B2B
3. Check recent launches (last 30 days)
4. If product interests you → cold email founder

**Template:**
```
Found your product on Product Hunt. Impressed by [specific feature].

I'm a full-stack engineer (Next.js, TypeScript, Python). Built similar systems.

If you're growing the team, I'd love to chat.

GitHub: github.com/agds-alt
```

---

### **Method 4: Indie Hackers / Startup Communities**

**Communities:**
- https://indiehackers.com/
- https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs
- Reddit: r/startups, r/SaaS
- Twitter: #buildinpublic

**Look for:**
- Founders sharing revenue milestones
- "Scaling from $X to $Y MRR"
- "Just raised funding"
- "Growing team"
