🚀 Just shipped a new feature!

Built a Redis caching layer that reduced dashboard load time by 95%.

Tech stack: Next.js, Upstash Redis, tRPC

Key learnings:
✅ Cache invalidation strategies
✅ Optimistic updates for UX
✅ Redis TTL management

What's your go-to caching strategy? 💬

#WebDev #NextJS #Redis #Performance
```

**Week 2:**
```
💡 Domain-Driven Design tip:

When building complex systems, start with the DOMAIN, not the database.

My approach:
1️⃣ Define bounded contexts
2️⃣ Model aggregates and entities
3️⃣ Establish domain events
4️⃣ Then design the DB schema

This leads to maintainable code that reflects business logic.

Agree or disagree? Let's discuss 👇

#DDD #SoftwareArchitecture #CleanCode
```

**Week 3:**
```
